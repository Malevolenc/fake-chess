This is my 2nd attempt at creating a chess web app. I created it with the intention of learning how to code with React. I originally tried to create this web app with just vanilla JS but I got annoyed by it and just decided to learn React.

I wanted to create a chess web app because I was inspired by the youtuber Sebastian Lague and his attempt at creating a chess bot, I was originally going to learn how to code in C++ and use the Unity Engine to create an actual application but I wanted my program to be as simple as the version in Chess.com.

In the future, I am planning to implement a simple chess bot that the player can play against, but right now, the only features in the game are:

- Moving pieces in the correct spots.
- Captures.

Additionally, this project was only focusing on how to use React, so anyone can view my source code.
